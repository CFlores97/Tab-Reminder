# Reminder Extension

## Description
This is a browser extension that helps you keep track of your tasks and reminders directly from your Chrome browser. It uniquely uses Chrome's storage along with notifications and alarms to manage your daily commitments. Each reminder is specific to the tab it was created in, ensuring that your tasks are well organized and contextually relevant. When you switch tabs, the reminders specific to the currently active tab will be loaded, making it easier to focus on the tasks relevant to what you are viewing.
